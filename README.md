## War of Cards 

## What is it?
- This is a two player game, and the aim is to collect all the cards. 
- The two players of this game are Player1 and CPU. 

## The rules of the game: 
- In our game we will be using a random number generator to pick a card for Player 1 and CPU. 
- The game will go in rounds, both players will place a card, the one with the higher value wins and collects both cards. The next round will begin. 
- In our game we have numbered our cards from 1 - 14, with Joker having the highest value (14), followed by King, then Queen, and all the way down to Ace having the lowest value (number 1).
- If both the cards are of the same value, we will have a Card War! 
- The game end when one player has collected all 54 cards (including the 2 Jokers), and our game will be keeping track of how many cards each player has in the form of a score. 

## Card War: 
- When we enter a Card War, three more cards will be chosen for each player and the third card will be compared with each other. 
- The player with the card of the high value will will the round, meaning they will collect the three cards they drew, the three card drawn by the other player and the two cards that entered them into the Card War!
- So that it is eight cards in total! 
- However, if third card drawn for the Card War matched the other player's card, then we have another Card War and three more cards are added! 
- Again, the value of the card will be compared, and the card of higher value wins the player 14 cards!
