/* 
Will take 2 arguments each round:
 - CPU
 - Player1

 These will both be numbers - but should have interface for tarnslating them into picture cards where relevant 

 will need a y/n to keep the loop going for eeach round to stop it immediatley finishing
 
 must be merged by 1pm tomorrow

 would be insanely hard version where it keeps track of which card from each array on each players hand - I dont think this was the idea when game suggested as medium 

 may be possible - will need array of 4 of each number and two jokers 
 will then need to keep track of each array and a serperate play array that gets added to winners hand each time
